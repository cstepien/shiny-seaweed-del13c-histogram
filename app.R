         This demo shows how seaweeds and other marine plants like surfgrasses use carbon in the oceans.
         It's a histogram - a count of how many seaweeds have a certain value - in this case, how many seaweed
         and surfgrass species have a certain tissue carbon isotope value, which tells us whether or not they
         can access bicarbonate for photosynthesis (see more below)."),

           This is a good question! When a lot of people think about climate change, 
           we hear a lot about CO2 in the atmosphere, global warming, but the flip side of this is 
           that the oceans act as big sponges, big sinks that just suck up all that extra carbon dioxide, 
           and that's actually changing the ocean chemistry – how much carbon is available to seaweeds, 
           what type of carbon is available to them, and these can have some implications for ocean 
           communities and ecosystems down the line."),

            In the oceans though, carbon dioxide is actually rare - less than 1% of all the dissolved inorganic
            carbon in water! So lots of seaweeds have swtiched over to using not only that rare carbon dioxide,
            but also the super-abundant bicarbonate. It's a little more costly energy-wise to use bicarbonate, 
            so no all seaweeds have adopted this new lifestyle.")),

         and which seaweeds can also use bicarbonate, all we have to do is look at
         the seaweed plant tissue - because it turns out, you are what you photosynthesize if you're
         a seaweed! Seaweeds that use ONLY carbon dioxide have very low (very negative) carbon isotope signatures (less than -30 units!),
         while seaweeds that use bicarbonate in addition to carbon dioxide have really high (less negative) carbon
         isotope signatures (greater than -30 units!). This has to do with the original isotope signatures
         of the carbon dioxide vs the bicarbonate - if you eat 'heavier' bicarbonate food as a seaweed, 
         you get a more positive isotope ratio. Seaweeds on the CO2 only diet, a much isotopically 'lighter'
         food, end up with more negative values. It turns out that most seaweeds are not on a diet. "),
